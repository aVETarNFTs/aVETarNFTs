## 🤔 Purpose
The purpose of the aVETars NFT collection is to celebrate and support the VeChain community by showcasing the creativity and talent of its members. A portion of the funds raised through the minting of these **1337 NFTs** will be used to create grants for both **new and experience VeChain developers**, which will be voted on by holders of the aVETars NFTs. Through this collection, we aim to showcase the best of what the VeChain ecosystem has to offer and drive innovation and growth within the community by supporting the development of new projects and ideas. So, the purpose of aVETars is to support and recognize the contributions of VeChain developers while fostering a sense of community and collaboration within the ecosystem.
